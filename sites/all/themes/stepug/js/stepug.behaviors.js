   * Behaviors are Drupal's way of applying JavaScript to a page. In short, the
   * advantage of Behaviors over a simple 'document.ready()' lies in how it
   * interacts with content loaded through Ajax. Opposed to the
   * 'document.ready()' event which is only fired once when the page is
   * initially loaded, behaviors get re-executed whenever something is added to
   * the page through Ajax.
   *
   * You can attach as many behaviors as you wish. In fact, instead of overloading
   * a single behavior with multiple, completely unrelated tasks you should create
   * a separate behavior for every separate task.
   *
   * In most cases, there is no good reason to NOT wrap your JavaScript code in a
   * behavior.
   *
   * @param context
   *   The context for which the behavior is being executed. This is either the
   *   full page or a piece of HTML that was just added through Ajax.
   * @param settings
   *   An array of settings (added through drupal_add_js()). Instead of accessing
   *   Drupal.settings directly you should use this because of potential
   *   modifications made by the Ajax callback that also produced 'context'.
